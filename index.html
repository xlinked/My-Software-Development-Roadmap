                <h4>Programming Logic & Design</h4>
                <p>This course provided me with a 
                    language- independent view of programming principles, 
                    structures and methodologies to foster the development of 
                    sound programming techniques before applying language specific 
                    syntax. I learned the traditional and object oriented 
                    concepts, terminology and programming structures before learning 
                    the details of a specific programming language. I learned to develop 
                    object- oriented program logic and apply commonly 
                    used programming structures of sequence, iteration, selection and 
                    decision-making constructs.</p>

                <h4>Programming Techniques</h4>
                <p>In this course, I continued to develop the 
                    programming skills that are required for developers to 
                    create Windows applications using the C# language. 
                    I reviewed the basic programming structures 
                    and implementation details of the C# language, and then 
                    consolidate my knowledge by building an application 
                    that incorporates several features of the .NET Framework. 
                    I also learned how to design and develop services 
                    that access local and remote data from various data sources. 
                    Topics include the C# Object Model, advanced properties, 
                    indexers, generics, and collection classes, performing complex 
                    queries over object collections with LINQ. By the end of this 
                    course, I was able to develop cloud-connected applications 
                    that seamlessly follow users across devices and build UWP applications 
                    that retrieve complex data via REST and present it intuitively.</p>

                <p>In this course, I learned to develop advanced 
                    ASP.NET MVC applications using .NET Framework tools and technologies. 
                    I learned to apply key ASP.NET Core components, 
                    including MVC for HTML generation, .NET Core, EF Core, 
                    ASP.NET identity, and dependency injection. I also learned 
                    how to integrate ASP.NET Core with leading client-side frameworks, 
                    including Bootstrap. The course explored the configuration, 
                    routing, controllers, views, and common tasks including posting forms, 
                    presenting data, performing complementary tasks such as error handling, 
                    logging, application design, authentication and localization. I also 
                     explored front-end development ensuring responsiveness of the application, 
                    creating mobile views, and providing advanced interactivity as well as 
                    middleware development to address data access, runtime architecture, and deployment.</p>

                <h4>OOP - Java</h4>
                <p>The primary objective of this course was to introduce me to the fundamental 
                    concepts and techniques of object-oriented programming using Java. I explored 
                    the features of Java by exploring its control structures, class libraries, methods 
                    and the application of OOP concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism. I also  
                    learned to apply error and exception handling concepts used in applications and Java applets. 
                    Upon completion of this course, I was able to create Java applications as well 
                    as functional applets using the JavaFX Graphical User Interfaces.</p>

                <h4>Adobe Photoshop</h4>
                <p>This course started with covering the key techniques for working with Photoshop. 
                    I learned the key elements of the Photoshop interface, and how the 
                    tools and features of this popular software can be used to edit images. 
                    I learned to use precise selection control to correct a wide range of 
                    lens- based errors, interactively transform their images with a variety of tools, 
                    effects and filters. With a focus on the key features and tools of Photoshop, 
                    I worked with layers, masks, channels, brushes and vector drawing 
                    techniques to prepare images for both Web and print production. The course then 
                    moved on to more detailed advanced features of Photoshop including raster based 
                    painting for illustrations, 3- D, video and animation techniques, colour controls, 
                    etc. I also learned how to use the techniques for designing with advanced 
                    layering and image compositing techniques, working with actions scripts, batch 
                    processes and other time saving options.

                    illustrating from photographic reference, and colourizing bitmapped images. 
                    After learning the functionality and techniques to produce basic professional 
                    quality illustrations, I moved on to explore the more advanced features 
                    of Illustrator by completing a series of advanced assignments. I 
                    gained an advanced understanding of the tool set, so I could solve more 
                    difficult design problems. Painting and Effects where also explored in detail. 
                    Projects did require a more sophisticated use of Illustrator techniques with 
                    a greater focus on finished quality and pre-press.</p>

                <h4>PHP and MYSQL Programming</h4>
                <p>This course explored the fundamentals of Web development and programming with 
                    PHP and MySQL. This course explored four key areas of PHP and MySQL; the programming 
                    constructs with PHP, accessing and manipulating data through the use of forms, object 
                    oriented programming with PHP and Web site security with PHP. I learned to 
                    work with PHP data types and operators, build functions and control structures, manipulate 
                    strings, access files and directories, process data in arrays and strings, work with MySQL 
                    databases and manipulate MySQL databases with PHP. I also learned how to manage 
                    state information, develop object- oriented PHP, handle errors and exceptions and debug PHP code.</p>

                <p>In this course, I continued to explore the creation of dynamic web pages by adding additional 
                    functionality to them using advanced JavaScript and JQuery. The goal is to make web pages highly 
                    functional by using the updated features of JQuery such as jQuery UI, navigation, tables, interactive 
                    capabilities, audio, and video integration. I learned how to work with the JQuery features that 
                    improve performance and speed and while using a variety of third-party jQuery plugins that can add more 
                    versatility to my web pages.</p>
